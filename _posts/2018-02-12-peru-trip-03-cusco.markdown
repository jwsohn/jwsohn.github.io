## 쿠스코(Cusco)를 소개하며

## 쿠스코에 도착해서

 * Cusco
    - The best place in this trip
      * Foundations from Inca, buildings from Spain
        - 12각 돌
      * The cathedral, the Peruvian undergraduate student
      * 그냥 걸어만 다녀도 좋음
        - Small shops: remember the narrow street?
    - Make sure that you book a train to Machu Picchu!
    - So many small stuffs around the town
    - Wonderful night time view
    - Morning: kids go to school
    - Weather
    - Alpaca shopping
      * From luxury to inexpensive
    - cusquena
  * How to get to Machu Picchu
    - Why hard?
      * Originally Inca Trail
      * Workaround for Inca Trail
    - Course planning
      * Easiest and expensive
        - Cusco, Ollan., Aguas Calientes via Peru Rail
        - Finally, take a bus to Machu Picchu 
          * Or walk hours
      * Original Inca Trail 
    - 고산병 (altitude sickness, mountain sickness)
      * Took a day for adjustment. Cusco's the highest at 3500m
      * Gets better since Machu Picchu is at lower altitude
      * Make sure you spend a day at Cusco
