# Tips
  * WinterReise im Croatia: pros and cons
    - pros:
      * Not so many tourists. No hustle-bustle. Good for a walkaround.
      * Cheap. Especially rental cars and hotels (apartments)
      * Mild climate on the Adriatic sea. Zagreb was not too cold.
    - cons: mostly side effects
      * Side effect of not so many tourists. Everything closes down early. 
        - Especially Plitvice national park. Entire Upper Lakes part was
          closed.
        - Zadar: the sea organ.
        - Dubrovnik: A city worth a nightvisit closes at 11pm entirely.
      * Side effect of mild climate: The sun sets too early!
        - It is already dark around 4:30pm
        - And the shops close early. You suddenly find that you do not have
          anything to do in this tourist city.
        - Winter in eastern europe: much rain. We were lucky to have only one
          rainy day during a whole week of travel.
