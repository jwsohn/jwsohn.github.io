    - 고산병 (altitude sickness, mountain sickness)
      * Took a day for adjustment. Cusco's the highest at 3500m
      * Gets better since Machupicchu is at lower altitude
      * Make sure you spend a day at Cusco
  * Cusco
    - The best place in this trip
      * Foundations from Inca, buildings from Spain
        - 12각 돌

      * 그냥 걸어만 다녀도 좋음

      * 버스표 예약 필수. 비싸도 좋은 곳에서 자기.
  * Machupicchu
    - Getting prepared:
      * Make a reservation before the trip
        - Daily quota of the traveller numbers at Machupicchu
      * Buy a bus pass a day before
        - Leaves every 30 minutes (almost)
      * It is a mess before you arrive there
      * Get up early so that you can have a sunrise at Machupicchu
        - Weather can be tricky; if you are lucky, you will have a grandiose
          view
      * Will take about a day
    - Our experience
      * Cameras can't contain the view
      * It is a legacy site, but feels very alive 
      * The one at the back: Can be hard to climb, but worth it
    - 참고: Titicaca lake?
  * Huacachina 
    - Intro
      * The only oasis in South America?
      * Good for travellers gathering place
        - Some hostels are awesome with partying travellers. Can be loud.
        - Good for a stopover before going to Cusco
      * Take a bus trip  
    - Buggy car trip to the desert
      * Nice pictures. Bring your camera. Target for sunset
  * Nazca
    - Not very much. 
    - Flight can be motion sickening. The ancient sites are rather smaller than your
      imagination
  * Back to Lima and wrap-up
    - One of the best life experience
    - Eye-wide open experience: Andes and Machupicchu
      * Cusco: a great blend of two cultures
      * Machupicchu: 이런곳이 있구나
